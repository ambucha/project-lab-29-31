project proposal: crop growth

project main idea: 

my project creates a crop growth simulation, designed to model how different environmental factors
affect the devolpment and productivity of crops over time. this simulation will show how cassava, 
cacao, and coffee grow, sprout, and harvested accross different fields. they will be affcted by 
changing weather conditions like rain, heat, etc. this should show how tinme, weather, and soil conditions
can change the overall performance of a farm.
i will use an std::map to store and manage data for each field on the farm. the key of the map will
be the field name, and the value will be 3 element arrat containnig 3 lists. each list will represent
one of the three crops. this should allow me to organize and update crop data as time goes on.
one map would be for a specific field. the three lists would represent the three crops in that field. another 
entry would be for a different field with its own distinct crops. each field will also have its own soil quality
and altitude in order to add difference between the fields.
the simulation will go for 30 time periods, each representing a day. during each step these events will happen:
- some crops will grow, getting closer to being harvestable
- some crops will be harvested
- some new crops might sprout
- weather effects: depending on the weather some crops may die, have stunted growth, or grow faster
