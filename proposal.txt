project proposal: crop growth

project main idea: 
the project will simulate crop growth and harvesting on a farm. each field will be an area of land, and every field will have
three types of crops, cassava, cacao, and coffee. the program will use a map data structure with the key being the field name,
and the value will be an array with three lists, one for each crop. this should make it easy to update as simulation time passes.
simulation will use time periods to show days passing. each period, plants will grow, new ones might sprout, and ones ready to be 
harvested will be harvested. also i can add maybe random weather in order to add difficulty to the project. these weather events 
will affect plant growth. rain could help while too much heat could stunt the growht (or maybe even kill some plants). the effects
will be output at the end of each time period. initial data will come from an external file, showing the starting conditions of the 
farm. this starting data will be minimum 100 lines long. imma run this for 30 time periods, that way itll be a full month, 25 would feel
incomplete. i will show the initial state, and then output at end of each time period how things have changed. goal of the project is
to show how changes in weather and time affect crop growth and the farms productivity, also each of the three farms will have different 
altitude and soil quality so that there will be differences between the map keys that will affect the crop growth and lead to more
interesting data.
