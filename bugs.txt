bugs encountered throughout the project:

Bug 1: i was missing a random seed, which was giving me the same results on each run,
simple fix of using srand(time(0)), seeding rand in main

Bug 2: I was passing harvest by value in simulate instead of by reference which made them print
as 0s even though plants were being harvested, fixed by changing to pass by reference

Bug 3: My harvesting check was == 6 instead of >= 6 which gave it a chance to accidentally not be harvested even when it should 
changing it to >= 6 is just a safer harvest check and allows for less error

Bug 4: i was rebuilding the rate and sprout maps every simulated day, which was adding inefficiency to my 
simulation, made it a static const instead which fixed that issue

Bug 5: I had no harvest tracking, so I was kind of not tracknig the most important data for the simulation
fixed this by adding a harvested map for perfield harvest totals, which gave me the needed data for this simulation

Bug 6: I had accidentally used == instead of = for growth chance, this was just a simple typo bug 

Bug 7: I was validating the wrong variable, getting unkown stage warnings when the data being entered looked fine, 
noticed it was because I was still checking crop instead of stage, fixed by now validating if(stage < 1 || stage > 6)

Bug 8: I had forgotten to add all the needed libraries earlier, simple fix adding the needed headers

Bug 9: I was not passing harvested parameter into the initial and final printState days, so I was getting issues there,
adding all the needed paramters even to the first day (and last day) of the simulation

Bug 10: I initially had no variable to tell me exactly which lines were giving me the errors in the data csv, so i did not kno
where to look in order to find my bad data, fixed by adding a line counter variable to help me find where the issue in the data is
