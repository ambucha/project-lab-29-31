unit testing plan

goal: make sure the load data and simulate functions work correctly 

1.loadData()
- should correctly read given csv fields
- should not accept poorly formatted lines 
- should then populate the map with the correct data values based off the given csv
2.simulate()
- advances crop stages based off of chance calculated through enviornmental conditions
- harvest crops when ready and sprouts new crops based off the given chances
- should keep a logical nonneg ammount of crops

-write a small driver program to test both functions separately
- use a controlled random to be able to reproduce results
- compare outputs displayed with what was expected

example code:
int main() {
    map<string, array<list<int>,3>> farm;
    bool check = loadData(farm, "farm_data.csv");
    if(!check){
        cout << "File load fail" << endl;
    }

    // print initial state
    printState(farm,0);

    // simulate just one day
    simulate(farm, 1);
    printState(farm,1)

    return 0;
}
